# Testing from 0 to 100

In December 2022 I presented the talk "Testing in Python, from 0 to 100"
at the monthly Python Valencia meetup. This repository contains the talk
slides, as well as some examples of code that were discussed in the talk.

The file `moon_locator.py` contains an easy example of code that calculates
the date & time when the moon will be located in the South. Then, there
are different tests that stress this code, including:

- An example of not-proper way to test: `this_is_not_a_proper_way_to_test.py
- Some easy tests using pytest: `test_moon_locator.py`
- A test using a pytest fixture: `test_with_fixture.py`
- A test using mocking: `test_with_mock.py`
- A test using property-based testing: `test_property_based.py`


## Instalation

You can create a virtual enviroment (pyenv, etc) and install the dependencies
from `requirements.txt` or you can use docker.

### Using docker

Build the image:
`docker build -t moon_image .`

Explore the container:
`docker run -ti moon_image bash`

Run a command (f.ex. pytest):
`docker run moon_image pytest -v`

### VS Code + Dev Containers

If you happen to use VS Code, you can install the Dev Container plugin and
work with the code inside a docker container. Just use "Reopen in container"
(as the Development Container config file is in the repo already).
Notice that you may need to install `Python` extension in Dev Container.

## Tests

### Usual tests (pytest)
Run pytest:
`docker run moon_image pytest -vv`

Run pytest with coverage:
`pytest -v --cov=. --cov-report=html .`

### Mutation testing (mutmut)

Run mutation testing:
`mutmut run --paths-to-mutate=.`

See results:
`mutmut results`

Show a mutation:
`mutmut show 1`

Execute one mutation:
`mutmut run 1 --paths-to-mutate=.`

### Property-based testing (hypothesis)

`pytest -v tests/test_property_based.py --hypothesis-show-statistics`
